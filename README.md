# iMedicine Inc. personal medical application for everyone.

## It's on developing way. Software performs you to keep whole data about medicaments, drugs, instruction of usage and what type of pain they prevent.
## Credential for test: 
    ## login:test@gmail.com, password:123456
    ## App will collect such type of data, as: email, username, country, city, race, bloodType, weight, height, age and etc. 
    ## Main idea software is that people will use different medicaments, will share with app, which drugs suit them in the best way. 
# How to setup:

## I used cocoapods as a dependency manager, SDWebImage, Firebase,SwiftUI,UIKit, SwiftyJSON and etc. 

## It's and MVP -> I stored data particullary on the server. On local base I have JSON file with the Account Settings. 

## First of all -> be sure, that your project's settings are equal to this: Architecture -> arm64, pods are installed correct, without repetitions, module with Firebase implemented in a correct way. Recommend to test it on iPhone 11, because as I said, it's MVP -> I didn't setup layout in a normal way.
